2 distinguishing feature
- trail-and-error search
- delayed reward
3 thing of RL
- problem
- class of solution of problem
- the field learning problem and solution

## formalization of RL
dynamical system theory, optmial control of incompetely-known Markov decision process
sensation, action, goal
## difference
### supervised learning
impractical to obtain example: correct and representative behavior of all situation
agents should learn from own exp
### unsupervised learning
hidden structure ---- maximum reward signal

## challenge
1. exploration and exploitation
2. consider whole prob
a complete, interactive, goal-seeking agent
interact directly with the rest of a system; indirectly with the environment
## simple principles of AI
RL -- psychology & neuroscience: humans' thinking

# Examples
- goal
- interaction
- uncertainty
- decision affect env 
# elements of RL
## reward signal & value function
RL algorithms -> method to estimate values 
model-based & model-free
