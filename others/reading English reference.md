Improving your English reading skills can be challenging, but with consistent practice and the right strategies, you can make significant progress. Here are some tips to help you improve your English reading skills:     
1. Start with familiar topics: Begin by reading articles or documents on topics that you are already familiar with. This will help you build confidence and understand the context more easily. 
2. Break it down: When reading long articles, break them into smaller sections or paragraphs. Read one section at a time, making sure you understand the main idea before moving on to the next. 
3. Use context clues: If you come across unfamiliar words, try to understand their meaning from the context of the sentence or paragraph. Look for clues such as synonyms, antonyms, or examples that can help you infer the word's meaning. 
4. Build vocabulary: Expand your vocabulary by learning new words regularly. Make a habit of noting down unfamiliar words and their meanings. Use flashcards or vocabulary apps to practice and review them regularly.
5. Read regularly: Consistency is key. Set aside dedicated time each day to read English articles or documents. Start with shorter pieces and gradually increase the length and complexity as you progress.
6. Use online resources: Take advantage of online resources such as language learning websites, blogs, or forums that provide simplified explanations of programming concepts or academic papers. These resources can help you understand complex topics in a more accessible way. 
7. Join English reading groups or clubs: Engage in discussions with fellow learners or join reading groups where you can discuss and analyze English articles together. This will not only improve your reading skills but also enhance your comprehension and critical thinking abilities. 
8. Practice active reading: Instead of passively reading, actively engage with the text. Ask yourself questions, summarize what you've read, or make connections to your own experiences. This will help you retain information better and improve your overall understanding.
10. Seek help when needed: If you encounter difficulties or have specific questions, don't hesitate to seek help from teachers, classmates, or online communities. They can provide guidance and clarification on challenging concepts or language usage. Remember, improving your English reading skills takes time and effort. Be patient with yourself and celebrate small victories along the way. With consistent practice and exposure to English texts, you will gradually become more comfortable and proficient in reading programming documents and academic papers.
